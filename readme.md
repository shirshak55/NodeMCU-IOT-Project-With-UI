## Using it
* You can open mobile hotspot and edito nodemcucode file in this repository. Change SSID and WPA Key in that file. 
* Open boff.php and bon.php file and edit those files to match IP address of Node MCU file

# Designing Circuit
* 5,13,12,14 pins get high. So use those pin to control TV, Light etc.
* First configure wifi module
* Then use relays matrix to switch operation
* Transitor should be used to power relay as node mcu provide low power signal which may not turn on realys
